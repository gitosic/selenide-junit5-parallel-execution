About this framework:

Scripts are written in plain language in gherkin annotations (https://habr.com/ru/articles/332754).
Steps, code and elements are written in separate places (page object pattern). 
To run in multiple threads, just change the value of the "parallelism" parameter(org/example/RunnerTest.java). 
The test report can be viewed here "src/test/resources/report/Cucumber.html"
